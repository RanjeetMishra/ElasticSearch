== Normalizers

beta[]

Normalizers are similar to analyzers except that they may only emit a single
token. As a consequence, they do not have a tokenizer and only accept a subset
of the available char filters and token filters. Only the filters that work on
a per-character basis are allowed. For instance a lowercasing filter would be
allowed, but not a stemming filter, which needs to look at the keyword as a
whole.

=== Custom normalizers

Elasticsearch does not ship with built-in normalizers so far, so the only way
to get one is by building a custom one. Custom normalizers take a list of char
<<analysis-charfilters, character filters>> and a list of
<<analysis-tokenfilters,token filters>>.
