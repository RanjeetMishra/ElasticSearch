=== Breaking changes in 7.0

==== Camel case and underscore parameters deprecated in 6.x have been removed
A  number of duplicate parameters deprecated in 6.x have been removed from
Bulk request, Multi Get request, Term Vectors request, and More Like This Query
requests.

The following camel case parameters have been removed:

* `opType`
* `versionType`, `_versionType`

The following parameters starting with underscore have been removed:

* `_parent`
* `_retry_on_conflict`
* `_routing`
* `_version`
* `_version_type`

Instead of these removed parameters, use their non camel case equivalents without
starting underscore, e.g. use `version_type` instead of `_version_type` or `versionType`.
