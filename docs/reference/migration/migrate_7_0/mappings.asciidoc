=== Mapping changes

==== The `_all` meta field is removed

The `_all` field deprecated in 6 have now been removed.

==== `index_options` for numeric fields has been removed

The `index_options` field for numeric  fields has been deprecated in 6 and has now been removed.

==== Limiting the number of `nested` json objects

To safeguard against out of memory errors, the number of nested json objects within a single
document across all fields has been limited to 10000. This default limit can be changed with
the index setting `index.mapping.nested_objects.limit`.
